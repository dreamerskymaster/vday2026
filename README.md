## Valentine Day app

A six-chapter, romantic interactive built with Next.js (App Router). Progress and responses are stored locally; final screen offers an export.

### Music
- Background track path: `public/audio/romantic-background.mp3`.
- A track is already provided: `John Legend - All of Me (Lyrics).mp3` (copied into `romantic-background.mp3`). Replace it with any royalty-free MP3 if needed.
- Music starts after the first user interaction; tap the music button if autoplay is blocked.

### Images
- Custom photos are available under `public/images/`. They are surfaced in the Memory Gallery photo strip.

### Getting Started
```bash
npm run dev
# or
